/**
 * You are given two eggs, and access to a 100-storey building. Both eggs are identical. The aim is to find out the highest floor from which an egg
 * will not break when dropped out of a window from that floor. If an egg is dropped and does not break, it is undamaged and can be dropped again.
 * However, once an egg is broken, thatâ€™s it for that egg. If an egg breaks when dropped from floor n, then it would also have broken from any floor
 * above that. If an egg survives a fall, then it will survive any fall shorter than that. The question is: What strategy should you adopt to minimize
 * the number egg drops it takes to find the solution?
